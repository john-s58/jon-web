I'm Jon, a software engineer with six years of experience building data systems and production applications.
I've built end-to-end data platforms, APIs and microservices in Go, Rust, and Python, and machine learning pipelines that serve real-time predictions. Most of my recent work involves Kubernetes, distributed systems, and internal tooling that helps teams ship faster.
I contribute to open source whenever I can and I'm always looking for interesting projects to work onâ€”whether that's open source contributions or early-stage startup ventures. Always learning, always building.
